# Important News Concerning the Sources of Anglo-Saxon Literary Culture (SASLC) Project Online

For the past few years, the online presence for the Sources of Anglo-Saxon Literary Culture (SASLC) has primarily been on the Wikispaces site developed with the help of Amsterdam University Press. On that site, the public could find information about the project and open-access files of previously published entries and books (such as the _Trial Version_ and ). Members who created accounts could access further parts of the site, such as information for contributors and drafts of works in progress.

Unfortunately, Wikispaces has decided to shutter its platform, and all accounts are being disabled by the end of this year. The SASLC site has recently been disabled as part of this process.

Nonetheless, there is also good news to report: SASLC continues to work with Amsterdam University Press to create a more robust, long-term website for the project. Wikispaces was meant to serve as a temporary site as we developed plans with AUP for a new platform. The editorial board continues to forge ahead in that regard. All of the files from the Wikispaces site (and more, all backed up by other means) will, in time, be migrated to a new platform.

The other good news is that, during this transition, SASLC will continue to maintain its open-access files online for all those who wish to continue to use them. Toward that end, all of these public files may now be found in a Github repository: https://github.com/SASLCproject/SASLC. Along with other information about the project (scroll down to see “About SASLC”) and documents for readers and contributors, all of the previously published entries are available to download (in the “Entries” folder). All materials in this repository (as with the previous site) are available under under an Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0) License. This Github repository will continue to be maintained and serve as the primary online access-point for SASLC until we develop the new platform.

The editorial board is excited about these developments toward a more robust online platform for SASLC. We will certainly announce more updates as they are appropriate. In the meantime, please feel free to contact any of us on the editorial board with any questions, or if you would like to be involved in the project. We are always looking for new contributors!
