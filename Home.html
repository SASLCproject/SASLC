<h1 id="toc0"><a name="About"></a>About</h1>
 The <em>Sources of Anglo-Saxon Literary Culture</em> is a longstanding project to map the sources that influenced the literary culture of Anglo-Saxon England. It aims at a comprehensive, descriptive list of all authors and works known in Britain between c. 500 and c. 1100 CE. <em>SASLC</em> <span style="line-height: 1.5;">has been re-envisioned for a digital world. Originally conceived of as a traditional encyclopedic resource, with entries published from A to Z, the potential of the multi-media environment provided by Amsterdam University Press has freed <em>SASLC</em> from the tyranny of the alphabet.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="line-height: 1.5;">You are using </span>an online facility available to the community of scholars who work on the sources of Anglo-Saxon literary culture to share ideas and work related to our common interest.<br />
<br />
Outcomes of <em>SASLC</em> will also include 1) published material available in printed form, <span style="line-height: 1.5;">in individual fascicles or grouped fascicles for major single-author entries such as Bede, or thematically related entries; and 2) an </span>online database to allow the free, public dissemination of all finished entries in a form that anyone can use.<br />
