# About SOEALLC
The Sources of Old English and Anglo-Latin Literary Culture, 500-1100 (SOEALLC, formerly Sources of Anglo-Saxon Literary Culture, or SASLC) is a longstanding endeavor to create a comprehensive bibliographic resource about all authors and works known in England between c. 500 CE and c. 1100 CE. Begun in 1983 as the result of an international symposium on the use of sources in works from early England, the project is fundamentally a scholarly resource that provides basic encyclopedic information about works and individual manuscripts that were important in early medieval literature and culture.

Major overarching objectives of SOEALLC include: 1) researching and printing scholarly entries about authors and works known in early England; 2) implementing open-access online publication of all finished entries as a public resource; and 3) creating a database of searchable and usable data gleaned from entries completed by contributors. Entries bundled together into print volumes will be published with Amsterdam University Press, while other entries and the database will be published online via Humanities Commons.

The primary audience of SOEALLC is interdisciplinary medievalists, therefore the project also provides comprehensive bibliographies of relevant scholarship in the fields of literary studies, religious studies, history, and art history, which must be regularly updated to reflect new publications. Ongoing SOEALLC work includes locating new articles and editions, compiling new entries and bibliographies, and editing contributions for online publication. In addition to this, we are also in the process of creating an online platform to facilitate publication of all finished entries of the project, with a database of searchable and usable data from entries already completed by contributors.

In 2019, the editorial board decided to change the name from the Sources of Anglo-Saxon Literary Culture (SASLC) to the Sources of Old English and Anglo-Latin Literary Culture, 500-1100 (SOEALLC). We hope that this new name indicates that the project remains focused on tracing the literary sources used by authors in England during this period as reflected in the manuscript record. At the same time, the editorial board feels that this new name more accurately represents the body of literature researched in this project and current historicized understandings of the field. In making this change, the editorial board would like to thank the scholars responsible for founding the project in the 1980s as well as BIPOC colleagues in the field who have recently worked to demonstrate the historically problematic nature of the term “Anglo-Saxon.” In this spirit, we seek to promote the values of equity, diversity, and inclusion for all those who research the various aspects of early England.
