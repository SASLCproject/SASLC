# About SOEALLC
The Sources of Old English and Anglo-Latin Literary Culture, 500-1100 (SOEALLC, formerely Sources of Anglo-Saxon Literary Culture, SASLC) is a longstanding project to map the sources that influenced the literary culture of early England. It aims at a comprehensive, descriptive list of all authors and works known in Britain between c. 500 and c. 1100 CE. SOEALLC has been re-envisioned for a digital world. Originally conceived of as a traditional encyclopedic resource, with entries published from A to Z, the potential of the multi-media environment provided by Amsterdam University Press has provided SOEALLC with a new publication model of print and online materials.

You are using an online repository available to the community of scholars who work on the sources of Old English and early Anglo-Latin literary culture to share ideas and work related to our common interest.

Outcomes of SOEALLC will also include 1) published material available in printed form, in individual fascicles or grouped fascicles for major single-author entries such as Bede, or thematically related entries; and 2) an online database to allow the free, public dissemination of all finished entries in a form that anyone can use.

This repository especially represents the materials available to the public while we build a new online platform for the publication of open access entries and a digital research center.
