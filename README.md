# About SASLC
The Sources of Anglo-Saxon Literary Culture is a longstanding project to map the sources that influenced the literary culture of Anglo-Saxon England. It aims at a comprehensive, descriptive list of all authors and works known in Britain between c. 500 and c. 1100 CE. SASLC has been re-envisioned for a digital world. Originally conceived of as a traditional encyclopedic resource, with entries published from A to Z, the potential of the multi-media environment provided by Amsterdam University Press has provided SASLC with a new publication model of print and online materials.

You are using an online repository available to the community of scholars who work on the sources of Anglo-Saxon literary culture to share ideas and work related to our common interest.

Outcomes of SASLC will also include 1) published material available in printed form, in individual fascicles or grouped fascicles for major single-author entries such as Bede, or thematically related entries; and 2) an online database to allow the free, public dissemination of all finished entries in a form that anyone can use.

This repository especially represents the materials available to the public while we build a new online platform for the publication of open access entries and a digital research center.
