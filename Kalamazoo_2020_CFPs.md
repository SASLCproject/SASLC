# SASLC Sessions at Kalamazoo 2019
The SASLC (Sources of Anglo-Saxon Literary Culture) Editorial Board is excited to share two CFPs for sessions at the ICMS in Kalamazoo in 2020.

## Session 1: Source Study and Undergraduate Research: A Roundtable
Even as graduate programs in language and literature continue to face serious funding constraints, more and more institutions are devoting significant resources to undergraduate research, recognizing the tremendous benefits it offers to students preparing to leave college and begin their working lives. Source study projects, which often involve significant amounts of data and profit greatly from the incorporation of digital tools, have much to offer to undergraduates who become involved: the ability to synthesize large amounts of information and manipulate it digitally is a critical skill, as is the ability to collaborate effectively with others, both in person and remotely. At the same time, the cost of getting students involved in source study has traditionally been high: the need for familiarity with multiple medieval languages, and for access to significant (and costly) suites of reference tools threaten to keep undergraduate students from making meaningful contributions to these projects. This roundtable will bring together scholar-teachers who have made efforts to incorporate undergraduates into source study projects in order to share their experience and communicate best practices for helping undergraduates to do meaningful research. Possible topics of discussion include, but are not limited to, source study and the digital humanities; source study in the undergraduate classroom; practices and protocols for source study projects; or source study and the teaching of language. While the SASLC project focuses specifically on source study within the Anglo-Saxon literary tradition, methodological inquiries of the sort we propose benefit from a diversity of voices—this roundtable therefore welcomes applicants from any field or period with some interest in the study of sources. It is our hope that presenters will be willing to share protocols and processes they have developed that facilitate the inclusion of undergraduates in source study projects, as well as to show some of the fruits of their labor.

## Session 2: Bede and Pseudo-Bede
It is a testament to Bede’s importance in the Middle Ages that his name took on a life of its own, attracting into its orbit a set of texts that were often attributed to Bede but were likely—in some cases certainly—not written by him. Canonical or not, this corpus of doubtful and/or spurious attributions, which we now call Pseudo-Bedan, made a significant contribution to Anglo-Saxon literary culture by itself, a contribution which the SASLC project hopes to elucidate with the volume on Pseudo-Bede currently in progress. As a part of that larger project, this panel seeks to understand the Pseudo-Bedan texts by putting them in dialogue with Bede’s canonical works, capitalizing on the SASLC volumes on Bede released from Amsterdam University Press in 2017 and 2018. We therefore invite submissions that further our understanding of Bede and/or Pseudo-Bede’s place within early Medieval literary culture. As Bede sits at the intersection of many disciplines, including theology, literature and history, the SASLC board welcomes a diverse range of topics and approaches: Bede’s influence on the early medieval tradition of Biblical commentary; the authorship of doubtful works like the Bedan penitential; the sources and consequences of Bede’s historiographical method; the literary influence of the pseudo-Bedan homilies. While we invite any submissions that consider Bedan or Pseudo-Bedan texts from a source-critical perspective, we are particularly excited to welcome papers that consider the stakes—both in the Anglo-Saxon period and now—of attributing a work definitively to Bede or not. Source criticism, as it seeks to determine and reflect upon the relationships between authors and texts, has great potential to wrestle with some of the field’s most pressing issues: canonicity, periodization, authority, audience. This session will therefore offer not only new insights about specific texts, but also new applications of source criticism that speak to the current needs of the field of Medieval Studies, and indeed to the needs of literary studies at large.

As always, the SASLC project does not pre-fill these panels: we welcome all abstracts, and wait to make our decisions about the sessions until all abstracts are in. Please send abstracts, along with a completed Participant Information Form, to Ben Weber (benjamin.weber@wheaton.edu) by the Congress deadline of September 15.
