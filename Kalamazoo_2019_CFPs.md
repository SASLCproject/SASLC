# SASLC Sessions at Kalamazoo 2019
The Sources of Anglo-Saxon Literary Culture (SASLC) project will sponsor two sessions at the 2019 ICMS in Kalamazoo: "The Old English Laws" and "Praecepta Magistri: The Benedictine Rule in Anglo-Saxon England." Below are the calls for papers for both sessions.

## "The Old English Laws"
In his 2000 review of volume 1 of Patrick Wormald's _The Making of English Law_, J. G. H. Hudson identifies as a key contribution of Wormald's work the argument that "legislation carried ideological weight, and this is clearly illustrated through study of the way in which manuscripts preserved their laws." This year’s SASLC session on the Old English laws seeks to carry Wormald's work one step further, considering how Anglo-Saxon texts using the laws as a source grapple with the "ideological weight" of the tradition. To that end, we invite papers that apply the methods of source study to the Old English laws. Papers in this session might include further work on the manuscript transmission of the laws, critical analyses of literary works that draw upon laws or legal language, as well as legal, social, or religious history that helps us to understand the important place of the laws in Anglo-Saxon culture. Given the affinities between Anglo-Saxon England and other northern European cultures, this session would also welcome papers interested in putting other legal cultures—like that of Iceland, or of the Carolingian Empire—in dialogue with Anglo-Saxon traditions. As in all the SASLC sessions, the editorial board seeks richness and diversity of method along with clarity of insight. While the laws are of clear importance to historians, especially legal historians, this panel aims to bring to light the complexities of Anglo-Saxon engagements with the law on all fronts. In bringing together scholars interested in the broad resonances of Anglo-Saxon legal texts, this session seeks also to honor Patrick Wormald, who before his passing submitted a draft of a SASLC entry on the Laws. To submit, please send an abstract of 300 words or less and a completed participant information form to Ben Weber (benjamin.weber@wheaton.edu) by September 15th.

## "Praecepta Magistri: The Benedictine Rule in Anglo-Saxon England"
To say that Benedict's _Rule_ was a foundational document for Anglo-Saxon England perhaps risks understating the case: monasticism was the engine of Anglo-Saxon intellectual culture, and Benedict's _Rule_ lay near the heart of Anglo-Saxon monasticism. All the same, scholars continue to debate the extent to which Anglo-Saxon monasticism could meaningfully be called "Benedictine" at various points, from the coming of Augustine of Canterbury all the way to the last chapter of the complex, controversial historical moment that is the Old English Benedictine Reform. There is no doubt, though, that the various efforts to strengthen Benedictine monasticism during the Anglo-Saxon period affected Anglo-Saxon literature and culture profoundly: witness the varying ideas of monasticism portrayed in Old English hagiographical texts; Wærferth's Old English translation of the _vita Benedicti_ contained in book II of Gregory's _Dialogues_; and the vibrant homilies and poetry produced during the Benedictine Reform itself. For this session, the SASLC board seeks submissions that pursue the Anglo-Saxon reception of Benedict through various avenues: translation studies; literary critical approaches; paleographical, codicological and book-historical investigations; religious, intellectual, and cultural histories; and more. While all the papers will look back to a single (and singularly) authoritative figure, we look to create a session that puts on display the methodological diversity and critical rigor that define source study as it is currently practiced, and that will reach beyond the confines of Anglo-Saxon England to consider Continental and perhaps post-Conquest milieu as well. The session will also serve to showcase the current state of interest in Anglo-Saxon engagements with Benedict ahead of the publication of SASLC's volume on Benedict, forthcoming from University of Amsterdam press. To submit, please send an abstract of 300 words or less and a completed participant information form to Ben Weber (benjamin.weber@wheaton.edu) by September 15th.

Needless to say, the editorial board is excited to sponsor both sessions, and we look forward to engaging and thought-provoking papers. It’s perhaps worth mentioning that we do not plan these sessions with presenters already in mind—all are encouraged to submit.
